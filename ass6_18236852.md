**Part 1: Setting up my Git Repository**

First I set my name and email address on Git so that it can record who is updating the versions of my files

`  git config --global user.name "kfanning1"
 git config --global user.email "kevin.fanning3@mail.dcu.ie"`



I next changed to my new directory which contains the three scripts required for this assignment

`cd thesis`

I next initialised this directory using `git init` which made the 'thesis' directory and its subdirectory's available to be version controlled by Git. This produced the following output:

*'Initialized empty Git repository in /home/kevin/thesis/.git/'*



I can use the command ``git status`` to see what files are being tracked by Git and what commits have been made. I can start tracking my files using ``git add``

``git add process.sh``

When I use ``git status`` process.sh is in the staging area highlighted in green, even though, obviously, there are no edits on it to be commited yet. However, since it is a new file in the Git repository, the whole file can still be committed in order to save the original version of it. The other two files are not bing tracked yet so are highlighted in red.



I next startr tracking the other two files

``git add clean.py analyze.R``

Since all the files are now in the staging, I can now commit them to keep their original editions saved. I can commit everything that's in the staging area in one go, like bringing an outbox of letters to the post office. If there's something in the staging area that I don't want to commit, e.g. 'analyze.R' then I simply type ``git rm --cached analyze.R``



I will now commit the files using ``git commit``

It is also possible to include a message that describes the changes you are making to these files and why by including `-m` followed by your message ``"message"`` after ``git commit``



If I want to look back through all the tracked changes to my files I can use ``git log`` to view all the different commits I made with the accompanying messages describing the updates. I can access the git identifiers of each of these 'snapshots' of my file so that I can retrieve them if I want to revert to the older version or compare them to the most up to date version.





**Part 2: Tracking and undoing edits **

I will now start editing the peak filtering parameters of clean.py  as per the tutorial, by opening it in nano text editor and increasing its minimum fold-change value for peak filtering from 10 to 20.



Doing ``gits status`` check, it shows the following in red: "modified:   clean.py"

Since these changes aren't staged, I can view them using ``git diff``

The output of this command shows the contents in the file with  'fc_cutoff = 10' , the original line specifying the fold change threshold highlighted in red having a '-' beside it and 'fc_cutoff = 20', the updated line being highlighted in green and having a '+' sign.



I can commit this change by adding the current file in the directory to the staging area and then making a commit. This time, as per tutorial instruction, I am undoing any changes I have made since my last commit using ``git checkout -- clean.py``.

I can also specify which version of this file I want to replace the unstaged edited file in my directory. Instead of typing '--' before the file, which automatically replaces it with the version in the staging area, or the latest commit if it's been commited from the staging area, I can type the first seven characters of the commit identifier of the version I want to replace it with. By typing ``git checkout f999a15 clean.py``, this will undo any edits I make prior to staging it and replace it with the commit with this identifier.



**Part 3: "Share your code"**



Having previously created a Github account 'kfanning1' , I had to create the remote repository ``thesis1`` online. Due to an error, i had to start this part again and create a second remote repository ``thesis1`` instead of ``thesis``. I next linked my local ``thesis`` repository to this remote ``thesis1`` repository as follows: ``git remote add origin1 https://github.com/kfanning1/thesis1``

'origin1' is a bookmark to this link.

I next push to the master copy of the repository as follows: `` git push origin1 master``

This pushed the commited files from my local repository to my remote repository.

I can download the 'thesis1' repository to mt computer as follows: 

``git clone https://github.com/kfanning1/thesis1``

I can also use ``git pull origin1 master`` to get an updated version of my file on a different computer



**Finally**

I have finished off by adding this markdown file to my ``thesis`` directory, committing it and pushing it to the ``thesis1`` repository on my github account

Here is the link to my thesis1 repository on Github:
https://github.com/kfanning1/thesis1
